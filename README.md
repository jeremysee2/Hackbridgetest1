# Hack Cambridge 101 (2020)

This repo is from Team Aegle. We made a demo of a software layer to synchronise Electronic Medical Records between different legacy EHR systems (both software and paper-based) using OCR from Microsoft Azure.

The code is written in Python and we used it to extract information from a demo patient form and sort it into a database on Azure. The front end was represented by a website design tool separately. This case uses Tkinter to simply select the file and input the required data.
